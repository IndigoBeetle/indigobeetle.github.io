FruitSpritzer has gone through more iterations than any other personal project
I've worked on. Starting out as a game created to experiment with the
[Corona2D](https://coronalabs.com/) engine, I then ported the same code to
Javascript (from Lua) to implement in [Phaser](https://phaser.io/), and finally
ported to [Godot](https://godotengine.org/), which is what you can find at the
link below.

It is different in that, unlike many match 3 games, the board is always active,
it doesn't prevent you making more moves while the effects of previous moves
are still being felt throughout the board, in fact, it actively encourages it,
speed is the key, don't delay, don't wait, just keep matching!
