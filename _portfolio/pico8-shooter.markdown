This SHMUP was created as a personal challenge to myself when I learned about
the great little project [Pico8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php), a
fantasy console that provides an extremely constrained environment in which to
create small games, 32KB of memory, tiny screen, limited colour palette, and
limited sound capabilities. 

I found myself drawing on my experience of creating games in constrained
environments back at the start of my career, working on games for the 8bit
micros of the day, the [Sinclair ZX
Spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum), [Commodore
64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64), and [Amstrad
CPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC).
