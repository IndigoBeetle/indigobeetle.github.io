Didn't manage to find anywhere near as much time this month for the challenge as in previous months, so not a great one, but enough to meet the criteria, a released, playable version of the original game. I did do, in total, 5 timelapse videos of an hour each of development work, each one compressed down to about 15 minutes running at 4x. I've linked 2 through 5 below (1 is on the previous blog post for this month), along with the released game on itch.io.

December is going to be as bad, if not worse, so hopefully I can find a Christmas themed game that is suitably easy to do and get out in time for the 25th. Don't expect too many blog posts this month either I'm afraid, hopefully can get back to more frequent posts in the new year.
