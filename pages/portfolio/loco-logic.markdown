For this jam I wanted to play with some ideas I've had for a while to create a game that
involves building things and solving puzzles. The game involves placing pieces of track, in
the right order to get the train to pick up the passengers and drop them off at the right 
stations.

A lot of time was spent on the game mechanic, which meant not a lot left out of the week to
build levels, but it's a fun concept that I might return to one day.
