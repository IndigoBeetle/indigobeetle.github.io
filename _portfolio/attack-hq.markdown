Attack HQ was a fun distraction for a week, and an opportunity to learn a new
game development tool that I'd never seen before starting this project,
GDevelop. So in the space of a week, I learned a new tool, and created a simple
game using it to submit to the game jam, where it received some very positive
feedback. I might even return to this one day and take it further, it was fun.

Unashamedly influenced by the great Atari arcade game,
[Rampart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rampart_(video_game))
