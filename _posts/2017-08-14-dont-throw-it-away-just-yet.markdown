  Why you shouldn't throw out those old laptops too quickly. The value of
  developing on older hardware.
---

As techies, we all desire the latest and greatest hardware, the most recent and
powerful MacBook Pro, the best of the best gaming laptop/desktop, but as
developers, we should be mindful of the target audience and aware that not
everyone is going to have, or want, such cutting edge equipment.

Clearly it's more fun to develop on a high powered MacBook or Windows
equivalent, things go faster, compile times are shorter, turnaround is
instantaneous, etc. Fitting your machine with a high speed solid state drive
can make you a "more efficient developer", that's the promise, right? You can
always excuse the massive expense of shiny new hardware by quoting the
efficiency benefits, right?

Well, yes, in a way, being efficient as a developer is a good thing, as long as
you don't lose sight of your target audience. Now, if your target audience is
high tech, front-runners, always on the latest hardware, knock yourself out.
But for the rest of us, it's invaluable at to get a reality check
occasionally, for many reasons.

Firstly, running your application on older hardware makes sense if your target
audience is likely to be running on older, less powerful equipment, that much
is obvious. But, I hear you say, you can do that as part of the QA process,
testing on representative hardware should be part of the QA process. Sure,
that's one way of looking at it, but you're missing one really important
aspect, nothing encourages efficiency than the direct pain of inefficiency.
That is, if you feel the pain of a slow development cycle, or worse, the
embarrassment of seeing your application running like a dog, you will be
"encouraged" to do something about it. This not only benefits your application,
and therefore your users, but your own development practices will be improved.
You'll find yourself naturally gravitating towards more optimal development
approaches, better code reuse, better separation of concerns, more efficient
caching, whatever the optimisations might be in your area, you'll instinctively
use them. And this is a win not only for the end user who has less powerful
hardware, the power user will see the benefit too, it's just all relative.

For this reason, I always force myself to split my development time between my
more powerful main machine, and my, tired bit still ultra-reliable, old 2010
white MacBook (not Pro). I know for a fact, if my games/applications run well
on that, they'll run pretty much anywhere. Some evenings, after a day of
hacking on the main machine, I sit down to some tinkering on the MacBook and
find that all my work has caused it to run poorly there. That's good, it's
caught early, I get to optimise live, on a machine that forces me to address
the performance issues, if only to overcome my own frustrations. In the
morning, the committed changes show an improvement over "good enough" on the
main machine, and chances are, I've experimented and learned some new
optimisation techniques along the way, win-win-win!
