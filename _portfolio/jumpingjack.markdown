![Jumping Jack](/images/portfolio/jack.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Jumping Jack was created for a Godot game jam, the theme of which was "Growth".
My daughter and I came up with the idea of a "Doodle Jump" style game with an
infinitely growing beanstalk, ala Jack and the Beanstalk. Created in a week,
including all artwork. Simple but fun, if perhaps a little too hard :).
