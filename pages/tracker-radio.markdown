During my work on [WeTracker](/pages/wetracker.html), I realised that there is
a wealth of, largely undiscovered, electronic music out there from the
"tracker" period of the mid 90's, much of which was created by talented
individuals in their bedrooms with Amiga or early PC computers. The folks at
modland.com have done a stalwart job of collecting them from various archives
and floppy disks, but I felt there must be a more modern way to listen, and
possibly to curate your own playlists of favourites. And so was born, Tracker
Radio.
