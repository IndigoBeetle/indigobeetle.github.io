Kwyll is a PC (Windows, Linux and Mac) based tool to help create retro games for
the old 8bit platforms of the 80's and 90's, initially targeting the Sinclair
ZX Spectrum. It is designed to be easy to use and fun for non-programmers to realise
their 2D retro styled game ideas, within the extreme constraints of the platforms
of that era, i.e. 48kb of memory, a 3.5MHz Z80 processor and a beeper for sound.
