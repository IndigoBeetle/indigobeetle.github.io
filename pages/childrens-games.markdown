These games were created for a freelance client who has written a number of
children's books based on some characters he created. He wanted some fun puzzle
games to play on the site promoting the books. The games I created, in pure
Javascript/HTML5 include, join-the-dots, spot-the-difference, a traditional
puzzle, and a maze game.
