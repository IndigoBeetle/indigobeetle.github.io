L﻿ast push now, almost done. Over the last couple of days I've added some polish, with sounds, SFX, and flow elements, such as a leaderboard and main menu. The leaderboard is, as usual, from my growing library of standard components and tools, so is common among all the RetroRemakes games, albeit with a different skin on each one. 

S﻿ounds, sourced from [Freesound.org](https://freesound.org/), include a cool futuristic engine sound from "wmquincy101" who I presume has worked on game audio before, as the single .wav file is well structured, with 4 "gear" progressions, each with a switch up aspect and a defined loop point, an engine start and engine stop section, and wmquincy101 kindly documents all the start/end/loop points to make it really easy to use in a game, kudos.

A﻿dded a simple main menu, and had a little fun using my very low poly biker enemy to create a background image, adding some motion blur and other post-processing in Blender's compositor to hide just how low poly they are, yeah I know, cheating, but hey I've only got a month to do all this!

I﻿ added a speed indicator to the dashboard of the 3D model of the player's bike, which I'm quite happy with, plan to add a "range" indicator alongside it before I'm done.

H﻿ad some fun making a big, multi-layered explosion particle system in Godot for when the player crashes into a tree, which you can see a few times in this video. 

I﻿'ve made a lot of tweaks to the way the rockets fire, in order to try to replicate better the shooting of the original, but it seems that in doing so I might have made it too difficult to aim, so will revisit that before the final release.

H﻿oping to release this week, way ahead of schedule, and get some well earned rest between my birthday and the end of the month before diving into the next one.
