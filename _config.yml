about-title: A Little About Me
about-description: |+
  Hi, I'm Paul Gregory.
  <br /><br />
  I'm a lifelong fanatic of all things technology, specialising in software
  engineering and architecture. I have a long career in this field, working
  with many great organisations, covering topics as diverse as film and TV
  special effects, mobile gaming, VR and insure-tech.
  <br /><br />
  I have a particular passion for the blend between creative media and 
  technology, and thrive on providing new and innovative solutions to enable
  and empower artistic people to create without boundaries.
  <br /><br />
  I apply 30+ years of experience in the software industry, from engineer to CTO, 
  working with some of the most talented people in the field, to design, plan 
  and implement with an extremely high level of rigour and quality.

features-title: Expertise
features-description: |+ 
  I believe strongly in an "engineering first" approach to software development,
  which means I consider every problem from a pure engineering perspective, agnostic 
  to any language or framework considerations, planning only how to best solve the
  problem at a high level. The result of this approach is that my expertise can be
  applied to any situation, and language choice is just a tool not a constraint. The 
  result of taking this approach to every situation means I have exposure to more than
  40 different languages and development systems, and the ability to choose the right
  tool for the job each time.

With excellent knowledge of all things technical, Paul can be relied upon to provide innovative and creative solutions to complex issues, which, will meet and exceed quality and customer expectations.

# Client
- name: Jonathan Privett
  url: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-privett-0353941/
  url-text: Head of Film & TV, Rushes Postproduction
  avatar: jonathan.jpg
  cite: Paul was an incredible asset to the team here at Rushes and his technical knowledge in the sphere of 3D rendering is immense. He also managed to learn the relevant software and write from scratch a shot tracking program showcasing his ability to change discipline and program pretty much anything. It was certainly a loss when Paul moved on and I'd recommend him to anyone seeking a resourceful and highly knowledgeable software architect.

# Client
- name: Bryan Salt
  url: https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-salt-7869ab17/
  url-text: Global Creative Director, Superscape Ltd.
  avatar: bryan.jpg
  cite: I was lucky enough to work with Paul for many years including my first job at incentive software, a company that produced ground breaking 3d games on low powered machines in the 80s. Paul was one of three cutting edge engineers that were some of the best I have worked with in my long career. What made Paul stand out was his ability to listen to the users, designers and other non programers, understand the business need and incorporate these needs into his design for the tools. 24 years later, Paul is still the guy I drop a call to if I have an impossible problem that no one else can help with, he is always happy to help out and point me in the right direction. I recommend Paul as a highly talented, open minded, flexible, experienced and thoroughly nice chap.

# Client
- name: Gavin Simpson

  url-text: GPU Compute Engineer, ARM Holdings
  avatar: gavhead.jpg
  cite: |+
    Paul is an outstanding engineer. I've worked with him over many years and can vouch that his software engineering skills are second to none. Complex mathematical problems (think 3D renderer) or more creative development skills, not a problem. He also has the knack of explaining tricky concepts in easy to understand terms which proves very reassuring.  
    <br /><br />
    In short, if you're looking for flawless advice, and a solid well engineered solution implemented impossibly quickly, seek out Paul.
