Sï»¿plat is a "Retro Remake" of a classic ZX Spectrum game originally released by Incentive Software in 1983. I created it as part of my Sinclair Spectrum 40th Anniversary challenge, to remake 12 classic Spectrum games in 12 months. You can read more about this challenge in my [blog](/blog), where I document the progress of each title as I build it.
