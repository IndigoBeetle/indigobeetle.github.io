Confuzion is a "Retro Remake" of a classic ZX Spectrum, Commodore64, AmstradCPC
and BBC Micro game originally released by Incentive Software in 1985. I created
it as part of my Sinclair ZX Spectrum 40th Anniversary challenge, to remake 
12 classic Spectrum games in 12 months. You can read more about this challenge
in my [blog](/blog), where I document the progress of each title as I build it.
