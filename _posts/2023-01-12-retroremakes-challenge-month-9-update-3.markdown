While a lot has changed, it's mostly under the hood at the moment, finalising gameplay features and the ability to define the different planets, so that I can soon add the other four planets and get this complete. This update is really just a quick one, to show off the planet destruction sequence I've been tinkering with, quite pleased with the way it turned out. As with all these things, especially particle systems, I could tinker forever, but at some point you've got to just say, that's good enough. As an aside, I did a very quick tutorial/tip video for anyone working with Godot to aide in creating these sort of multi-layered VFX sequences, just a little trick I came up with to make it easier to do, https://youtu.be/JQEbhUu6B78.
