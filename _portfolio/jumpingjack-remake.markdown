Jumping Jack is a "Retro Remake" of a classic ZX Spectrum, game originally
released by Imagine Software in 1983. I created it as part of my Sinclair ZX
Spectrum 40th Anniversary challenge, to remake 12 classic Spectrum games in 12
months. You can read more about this challenge in my [blog](/blog), where I
document the progress of each title as I build it.
