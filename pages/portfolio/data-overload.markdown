For this jam, I decided to experiment with some "Tron" style visuals, see if I could make
Godot create something other-worldly like Tron, with glowing wireframes to give the impression
of being "inside the mainframe".

I also played with the idea of a "battle" subgame, an idea shamelessly "borrowed" from the great
Quazatron by Hewson Consultants.
