about-title: A Little About Me
about-description: |+
  Hi, I'm Paul, a self confessed nerd and part time geek.
  <br /><br />
  My overriding goal in life is to create hi-tech tools for non-hi-tech people. 
  I thrive on building software that unlocks the creative potential of others, 
  and am always on the lookout for the next big thing that brings technology to
  a new audience in a way that hasn't been achieved before.
  <br /><br />
  I enjoy everything to do with creative media and entertainement, from games to 
  films and everything in-between. Working with creative teams most of my career
  gives me an insight into the ways of working and enables me to understand the 
  needs of the creative individual, digging under the superficial request to find
  unique and innovative solutions.
  <br /><br />
  I apply 30 years of experience in the software industry, working with some of
  the most talented people in the field, to design, plan and implement with an
  extremely high level of rigour and quality.

With excellent knowledge of all things technical, Paul can be relied upon to provide innovative and creative solutions to complex issues, which, will meet and exceed quality and customer expectations.

# Client
- name: Jonathan Privett
  url: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-privett-0353941/
  url-text: Head of Film & TV, Rushes Postproduction
  avatar: jonathan.jpg
  cite: Paul was an incredible asset to the team here at Rushes and his technical knowledge in the sphere of 3D rendering is immense. He also managed to learn the relevant software and write from scratch a shot tracking program showcasing his ability to change discipline and program pretty much anything. It was certainly a loss when Paul moved on and I'd recommend him to anyone seeking a resourceful and highly knowledgeable software architect.

# Client
- name: Bryan Salt
  url: https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-salt-7869ab17/
  url-text: Global Creative Director, Superscape Ltd.
  avatar: bryan.jpg
  cite: I was lucky enough to work with Paul for many years including my first job at incentive software, a company that produced ground breaking 3d games on low powered machines in the 80s. Paul was one of three cutting edge engineers that were some of the best I have worked with in my long career. What made Paul stand out was his ability to listen to the users, designers and other non programers, understand the business need and incorporate these needs into his design for the tools. 24 years later, Paul is still the guy I drop a call to if I have an impossible problem that no one else can help with, he is always happy to help out and point me in the right direction. I recommend Paul as a highly talented, open minded, flexible, experienced and thoroughly nice chap.

# Client
- name: Gavin Simpson

  url-text: GPU Compute Engineer, ARM Holdings

    Paul is an outstanding engineer. I've worked with him over many years and can vouch that his software engineering skills are second to none. Complex mathematical problems (think 3D renderer) or more creative development skills, not a problem. He also has the knack of explaining tricky concepts in easy to understand terms which proves very reassuring.  
    <br /><br />
    In short, if you're looking for flawless advice, and a solid well engineered solution implemented impossibly quickly, seek out Paul.
