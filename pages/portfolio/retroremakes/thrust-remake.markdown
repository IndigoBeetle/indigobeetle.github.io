Thrust is a "Retro Remake" of the Spectrum game from Firebird, circa 1986. I created it as part of my Sinclair Spectrum 40th Anniversary challenge, to remake 12 classic Spectrum games in 12 months. You can read more about this challenge in my blog, where I document the progress of each title as I build it.
