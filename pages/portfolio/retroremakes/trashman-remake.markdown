Trashman is a "Retro Remake" of the classic Spectrum game from New Generation, circa 1984. I created it as part of my Sinclair Spectrum 40th Anniversary challenge, to remake 12 classic Spectrum games in 12 months. You can read more about this challenge in my [blog](https://www.indigobeetle.co.uk/blog), where I document the progress of each title as I build it.
