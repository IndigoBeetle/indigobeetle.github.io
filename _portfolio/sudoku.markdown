description: A simple, free, no frills Sudoku game, because I didn't like any of
  the options in the App Store.
---
I sometimes enjoy a game of sudoku, just to pass the time, I'm not great at it, but hey. I tried loads of options on the iOS App Store, and found all to be lacking in some respect. Some were ad-heavy, which annoys me to the core, some were just really poorly implemented with (IMHO) a bad user experience design, others just tried to do too many things, and some were guilty of multiple of these crimes. I felt I could make one I enjoyed better, so I did, in a weekend.

It's currently only available as a web app, but I'll be releasing it for free, not ad-supported, just what it is, on iOS and Android stores soon.
