Cact-Eye was created for a Godot game jam in a week. The theme of the jam was
"Out of Place Cacti", a strange one, but I'm always up for a challenge. A short
discussion with a colleague of mine at the time led to the concept of a
platformer with a "sticky" protagonist. Creating the control mechanism in such
a short time was a challenge, but I'm very happy with how it worked out, the
game is very playable, and the control mechanism quite intuitive.
